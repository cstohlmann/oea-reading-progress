# Data
The Reading Progress module includes artificially generated data which were derived from the [Microsoft Education Insights](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/module_catalog/Microsoft_Education_Insights/test_data) data sources.

## Data Dictionary
This module creates 3 tables: [ReadingProgress_activity](
https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/blob/main/modules/module_catalog/Reading_Progress/data/README.md#readingprogress_activity), [Student](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/blob/main/modules/module_catalog/Reading_Progress/data/README.md#student) and Student_lookup (dictionary of mapping hashed/masked fields to raw data).
